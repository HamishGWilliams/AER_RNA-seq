# AER_RNA-seq
My RNA-seq code that I will use for processing the RNA-seq data provided from David Fisher from previous experiments. I will attempt to automate processes where possible so that it is more streamlined to perform the same analyses in the future, for my research and for other research. 

# Purpose
- To learn how to use and manage projects on GitHub, contributing to my PG Cert (credits through professional development).
- Create an accessible repository for the Evolutionary Ethology Lab (EEL) for conducting RNA-seq and Differential Expression analyses (DEA).
- To show a timeline of my learning to perform RNA-seq and DEA for others to understand and appreciate that learning a new analytical technique is a process
- To explain each step of the analyses, so that others can hopefully understand the underlying processes.
- To successfully perform RNA-seq and DEA on Actinia Equina samples for my research
- To develop automated functions and processes to streamline Data processing, analysis, and exporting of end-point tables, figures and graphs.
- To test the ability of AI technology to create reliable functions and code for streamlining analytical processes: https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/

# RNA-seq & DEA code
For most of the analysis performed, original code and information on how to perform the RNA-seq and Differential Expression analysis is from https://compgenomr.github.io/book/. In particular, Chapter 8 is where the step-by-step breakdown of all of the RNA-seq and Differential Expression analyses is found. Initially, the raw code I will produce will be taken straight from this open source book, but will fine tune the inputs/outputs and code for my specific research. I will keep a timeline of my progress, outlining changes made, and why.

# Message for others
I'm not 100% how this GitHub thing really works, so to anyone with access to thie repository, I ask that you don't edit any of the branhces without permission or prior dicussion of what you will do and/or change. Feel free to contirbute comments or suggestions on how to improve the code, or ask questions about specigic parts - I will do my best to explain to the best of my ability, I'm still learning too!

This README page will likely change in the future as I get more comfortable and fimilar with GitHub and its tools and expectations.
